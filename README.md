# Fridge Game Engine

This is an in-development generic game engine for simple, multiplayer card games and board games. Game are intended to be played online (over the internet) with a simple, ASCII art front end.

## Goals

The first goal is the only primary goal of this project. All other goals are very minor, secondary goals.

1. Self improvement and education about developing backend services in rust.
1. To implement a new game in a weekend, so that I can preview games I'm interested in buying physical copies of.
1. To implement my own concepts of games (if I ever have any).
1. To give friends and colleagues a platform to implement their own games without having boiler plate service/client infrastructure.

Intentionally not mentioning anything about the front end/UI development.

# Games

Ideally (and the long term goal), the individual game implementations would exist in their own repo. Since this is a project only for personal learning, I am simply implementing the games in-repo here for now.
